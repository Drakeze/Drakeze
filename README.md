# 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Shead

I’m a full-stack developer focused on building clean, maintainable systems and documenting my growth as an engineer.

My work centers around modern web applications, API integration, and long-term project design. I treat development as an evolving process, not just a collection of finished demos.

##  Where to Start

If you’re visiting this profile, the best place to start is my **Portfolio** and **Organizations**.

### Featured Organizations

- **SorenTech**  
  A technology-focused organization exploring modern full-stack development, internal tooling, and scalable application design.  
  🔗 [Soren Tech](https://github.com/SorenLab)

- **Earth Plus**  
  A sustainability-driven initiative connecting technology, structure, and long-term impact.  
  🔗 [Earth Plus](https://github.com/EarthPlus-Organization)

These organizations represent the long-term direction of my work more than any single repository.

##  Portfolio

My portfolio acts as a [**central hub**](https://portfolio-git-fix-admin-sorenlab-projects.vercel.app/) for my projects and ongoing work.

It is designed to present clearly:
- Real, deployed applications  
- Ongoing and planned projects  
- Clear documentation and intent  
- Incremental growth over time  

From the portfolio, you can explore:
- A cryptocurrency tracking application  
- A multi-platform blog platform  
- A planned analytics/dashboard project  
- A learning-focused Growth Vault

##  How I Approach Development

- I prioritize **structure and clarity** over rushing features  
- I document intent, not just outcomes  
- I complete foundational systems before expanding the scope  
- I intentionally explore unfamiliar areas to avoid becoming locked into a single pattern or stack  

Some repositories are intentionally minimal to reflect planning stages rather than unfinished work.

---

##  Learning & Growth

I actively document what I’m learning through a dedicated **Growth Vault**.

This space focuses on:
- Skill progression over time  
- Technical experimentation  
- Notes, reflections, and emerging patterns  
- Trying new tools, approaches, and architectures  

This is intentionally separated from production projects and exists to show **how I think and grow**, not just what I already know.

## 🤝 Community & Journey

I maintain a [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/SorenTech?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_fan&utm_content=copyLink) that documents my development journey.

It is not tied to a single company or product.  
It exists to share:
- Process  
- Lessons learned  
- Behind-the-scenes work  
- Ongoing growth as an engineer  

The focus is on learning, iteration, and consistency, not promotion.
